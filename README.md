# clj-ring-aws-tvm

You can use this library if you need a token vending machine for AWS,
similar to the one described at [this AWS article](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/4611615499399490)

It provides a function for creating [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) [handlers](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts)

**Please be aware that it doesn't take care of authentication, you'll
  need to create your own Ring middleware to handle that**
